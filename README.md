Feed assistant Telegram bot written in Go.

## Functionality

- Follow RSS / Atom / JSON feeds and public Telegram channels by sending URLs,
  channel `@username` slugs, or forwarding messages from channels to bot
- Get feed list with `/list`
- Unfollow feeds directly from list
- Receive 24h auto-digest daily automatically (default - 00:00 UTC)
- Receive 24h digest with `/digest`
- Summarize Telegram channel posts with OpenAI (falls back to local truncation
  when `OPENAI_API_KEY` is not provided)
- Message format:
  - RSS / Atom / JSON feeds: grouped digest with post titles and links
  - Telegram channels: digest bullet with AI summary (or trimmed message text)
    linking to the original post
- Configure user settings with `/settings`
